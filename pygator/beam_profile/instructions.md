How to use

### Beam Profile with Propagation
python beam_profile.py --roi-size 400 --downsample 2 --exposure auto --gain auto --pixel-size 6.9 --output my_beam_scan.csv


ROI: is the region of interest. It's a square shape around the highest peak with a size equal to the number of pixels. In this example it's a square of 350 pixel side length. 

downsample:
âœ… What Happens with Downsampling in the Code

When we downsample like this:
```
cropped = cv2.resize(cropped, (cropped.shape[1] // downsample, cropped.shape[0] // downsample),
                     interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
```

weâ€™re using:

ðŸ“‰ cv2.INTER_AREA interpolation

This does approximate area-based resampling, which is similar to averaging pixels together â€” especially when downsampling by integer factors like 2 or 4.

So, for example:

If downsample=2, OpenCV effectively averages 2Ã—2 pixel blocks into one pixel.

If downsample=4, it uses 4Ã—4 blocks, and so on.

This isnâ€™t a naive pixel-wise average but a resampling algorithm that gives similar results with more accurate interpolation.
 
--pixel-size is the camera's pixel size. 
--output is the name of the CSV file to be saved, if chosen




### Live fitting without saving data

python live_camera_fit.py --mode heatmap --roi-size 350 --downsample 2 --exposure 10000 --gain 0


Fitting a 2D gaussian to the beam live. This doesn't save the data. The parameters are in units of pixel numbers.
